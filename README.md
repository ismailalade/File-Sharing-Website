MOCK-UPS
File-sharing website mock-ups are visual representations of the site's interface and functionality before actual development. They typically include designs for uploading, downloading, file organisation, user profiles, and navigation. Mock-ups help stakeholders visualise the site's layout, features, and user flow, aiding in feedback and refining the final product.
